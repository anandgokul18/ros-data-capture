This package is currently a work in progress.

It aims to be a way of doing longterm data recording using the Robot Operating System.  It will include ways to get video, audio, and log data.  To save them as files and, optionally, to upload them to S3 storage on Amazon Web Services.  

This is necessary because in longer human-robot interactions too much data may be created to be stored locally, depending on the data sources.
